            <p>Happy one year anniversary! I love you so, so much!<br><br>
                I don't know if the past year has felt so long or so short. I think it's been a dedicated year.<br><br>
                We've been through so many growing pains, but only because we care about each other so, so much. I think the growing pains come with being eager to grow.<br><br>
                Sometimes, I wish that we could have met later, when I'd be more mature and less selfish, but I'm so grateful that it was you that I met a year ago.<br>
                I'm so lucky to hold your heart and have someone so kind and gentle hold mine.<br><br>
                I hope you know how much I love you, just as you are.<br>
                I'll work harder so that you feel it every single day.<br><br>
                I'm so excited and I can't wait to be working adults together,<br>
                to be in the same city together, and to share our lives with each other.ðŸ’–
